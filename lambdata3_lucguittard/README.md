# lambdata3

This repo contains some practice examples of work with the following:
    classes/objects, initializers, instance methods, sub-classes/inheritance of object oriented programming (OOP); 
    unittests;
    pytests.

The repo itself may serve as a blueprint for package creation via GitHub:
    The lambdata3 directory (created using mkdir in python) is a GitHub repository; 
    The lambdata3_lucguittard subdirectory is a package ready for import and containing 
    functions in python (.py) files;
    Accompanying the package are the following: setup.py, Pipfile, LICENSE, and README;
    Within the package is always found an __init__.py file which allows for OOP; 
    The df_tool1.py file and df_utils.py files contain simple examples of OOP with
    the ToolBox subfolder containing additional examples;
    The pytests and unittests subfolders contain examples and details for running unittest and pytest.
